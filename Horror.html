                    The Horror genre has a lot of common with Mystery. But if the Mystery is 
                    just telling about some unexplainable and mysterious things, the main 
                    mission of Horror is to scare up to the death! Horror books are full of
                     the stories about ghosts, spirits, monsters, supernatural phenomes which 
                     can make some very terrible things with people. The plot of the Horror 
                     book is mainly not real and fantastic. The authors are not greedy for 
                     blood and screams. This genre is not for nervous people. The reader can 
                     meet the most terrible and sophisticated ways of murdering in it. Reading 
                     Horror makes people believe in impossible, in something which causes the 
                     blood to run cold.

                Aspiring mycologist Sydney Denik is getting a second chance. When a dream 
                opportunity presents itself with a prestigious foundation doing promising 
                Alzheimer's research, Sydney leaves the shambles of her old life to join a 
                dozen other grad students at an isolated lodge hidden away in a remote, 
                fog-shrouded inlet on Vancouver Island.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;text-align: justify;">
                But the Madrona Foundation harbors more than brilliant minds. Everyone around
                 her is hiding a terrible secret—including the resident psychologist she's 
                 falling in love with. A student disappears, and no one but Sydney seems 
                 to care. Ghosts walk the halls. Snow falls in the middle of summer. Dead 
                 animals move like the living. The more Sydney uncovers about the foundation,
                  the more she begins to question her own sanity. And if Sydney isn't going 
                  mad, then the horrors in the surrounding forest are real, and the Madrona 
                  Foundation may be the biggest monster of all.

                I didn't even know where he was.
                I didn't want to say goodbye to Helen. I didn't want to go back there. 
                That was the problem: I didn't have to. There was nowhere left in the 
                world where the mountain couldn't simply pick up and move to Mohammed. 
                Heaven was merely a suburb of the global village, and the global village 
                left me no excuse.

                I linked from my own apartment. My new inlays—mission-specific, 
                slid into my head just the week before—shook hands with the noosphere 
                and knocked upon the Pearly Gates. Some tame spirit, more plausible than 
                Saint Peter if no less ethereal, took a message and disappeared. 
                And I was inside.

                This was no antechamber, no visiting room. Heaven was not intended for 
                the casual visitor; any paradise in which the flesh-constrained would 
                feel at home would have been intolerably pedestrian to the disembodied 
                souls who lived there. Of course, there was no reason why visitor and 
                resident had to share the same view.
