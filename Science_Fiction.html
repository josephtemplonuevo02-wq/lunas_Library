                    In a  science fiction genre, we can notice on one side a depiction of a 
                    real world, however, on the other side, it is a full of 
                    excogitation. Usually, this world is changed with help of 
                    one very fantastic and unreal thing which theoretically could 
                    happen. It can be a huge apocalypse which has changed the whole 
                    planet or some kind of zombie incursion, or even an alien invasion.

                Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, 
                a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run 
                accident when he was ten, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to 
                take care of himself—and his dad. Then, when Charlie is seventeen, he meets Howard 
                Bowditch, a recluse with a big dog in a big house at the top of a big hill. In the 
                backyard is a locked shed from which strange sounds emerge, as if some creature is 
                trying to escape. When Mr. Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie the house, a massive 
                amount of gold, a cassette tape telling a story that is impossible to believe, 
                and a responsibility far too massive for a boy to shoulder.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;text-align: justify;">
                Because within the shed is a portal to another world—one whose denizens are in peril
                 and whose monstrous leaders may destroy their own world, and ours. In this parallel 
                 universe, where two moons race across the sky, and the grand towers of a sprawling
                  palace pierce the clouds, there are exiled princesses and princes who suffer horrific 
                  punishments; there are dungeons; there are games in which men and women must fight 
                  each other to the death for the amusement of the “Fair One.” And there is a magic 
                  sundial that can turn back time.

                A story as old as myth, and as startling and iconic as the rest of King's work, 
                Fairy Tale is about an ordinary guy forced into the hero's role by circumstance, 
                and it is both spectacularly suspenseful and satisfying.

                I didn't even know where he was.
                I didn't want to say goodbye to Helen. I didn't want to go back there. 
                That was the problem: I didn't have to. There was nowhere left in the 
                world where the mountain couldn't simply pick up and move to Mohammed. 
                Heaven was merely a suburb of the global village, and the global village 
                left me no excuse.

                I linked from my own apartment. My new inlays—mission-specific, 
                slid into my head just the week before—shook hands with the noosphere 
                and knocked upon the Pearly Gates. Some tame spirit, more plausible than 
                Saint Peter if no less ethereal, took a message and disappeared. 
                And I was inside.

                This was no antechamber, no visiting room. Heaven was not intended for 
                the casual visitor; any paradise in which the flesh-constrained would 
                feel at home would have been intolerably pedestrian to the disembodied 
                souls who lived there. Of course, there was no reason why visitor and 
                resident had to share the same view.
