                    Fantasy as a genre has its roots in ancient times. It grew out of mythology, 
                    beliefs in supernatural beings, numerous gods, and imaginative explanations of how 
                    the world was created. Its origins can be traced back to old legends and tales passed 
                    down through generations. Today, however, fantasy can be seen as a unique kind of fairy 
                    tale written for adults.

                Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, 
                a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run 
                accident when he was ten, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to 
                take care of himself—and his dad. Then, when Charlie is seventeen, he meets Howard 
                Bowditch, a recluse with a big dog in a big house at the top of a big hill. In the 
                backyard is a locked shed from which strange sounds emerge, as if some creature is 
                trying to escape. When Mr. Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie the house, a massive 
                amount of gold, a cassette tape telling a story that is impossible to believe, 
                and a responsibility far too massive for a boy to shoulder.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;text-align: justify;">
                Because within the shed is a portal to another world—one whose denizens are in peril
                 and whose monstrous leaders may destroy their own world, and ours. In this parallel 
                 universe, where two moons race across the sky, and the grand towers of a sprawling
                  palace pierce the clouds, there are exiled princesses and princes who suffer horrific 
                  punishments; there are dungeons; there are games in which men and women must fight 
                  each other to the death for the amusement of the “Fair One.” And there is a magic 
                  sundial that can turn back time.

                A story as old as myth, and as startling and iconic as the rest of King's work, 
                Fairy Tale is about an ordinary guy forced into the hero's role by circumstance, 
                and it is both spectacularly suspenseful and satisfying.
