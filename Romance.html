                    Romance originated in medieval France. Reading this genre person 
                    can be involved into a beautiful story of two enamored people who 
                    love each other to the craziness, to the death. Very often the plot
                     of romance books is full of difficulties which prevent two halves 
                     to be together, however they overcome all the obstacles due to 
                     their great and pure love. Sometimes this genre makes cry, sometimes
                      makes immerse in dreams. It is always very sentimental. The story 
                      can by real or fictional, it does not matter.

                Aspiring mycologist Sydney Denik is getting a second chance. When a dream 
                opportunity presents itself with a prestigious foundation doing promising 
                Alzheimer's research, Sydney leaves the shambles of her old life to join a 
                dozen other grad students at an isolated lodge hidden away in a remote, 
                fog-shrouded inlet on Vancouver Island.

                But the Madrona Foundation harbors more than brilliant minds. Everyone around
                 her is hiding a terrible secret—including the resident psychologist she's 
                 falling in love with. A student disappears, and no one but Sydney seems 
                 to care. Ghosts walk the halls. Snow falls in the middle of summer. Dead 
                 animals move like the living. The more Sydney uncovers about the foundation,
                  the more she begins to question her own sanity. And if Sydney isn't going 
                  mad, then the horrors in the surrounding forest are real, and the Madrona 
                  Foundation may be the biggest monster of all.
